West half of a room?

You can peer through parts of the wall to see the adjacent rooms. You can even see the east half of this room, but you cannot traverse there from where you stand due to the large gap that has divided the room into two.

The void

This room is dark, with a single lantern hanging up high, barely providing any light. As you peer around the dark room, you notice each crystalized wall casts your reflection. Maybe this room is for pondering. You were lucky to find the outline of both doors located southbound and northbound. The difficult part is figuring out which is which.

The Final Balcony

The balcony is so high up you feel like you can almost touch the whirling clouds in the night sky. The princess is chained up against the carefully crafted metal railing, begging for your rescue. Thunder and lightning flash along the horizon, giving only a temporary amount of light to see your surroundings. Fire and smoke erupt from far below, giving a reddish hue to anything you can see.
