West half of a room?

The balcony is so high up you feel like you can almost touch the whirling clouds in the night sky. The princess is chained up against the carefully crafted metal railing, begging for your rescue. Thunder and lightning flash along the horizon, giving only a temporary amount of light to see your surroundings. Fire and smoke erupt from far below, giving a reddish hue to anything you can see.
